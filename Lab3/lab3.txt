Q1. This problem emphasizes on Data Scaling, Binarization and Standardization. 
Use the Pima Indians diabetes dataset which is often used for binary classification problem. 
Do the following using suitable python library using this dataset. 

Note: use only the feature information of this dataset (exclude the label/class information). 
    1. Since the attributes present in this dataset is of different scales, first rescale 
         the attributes of this dataset so that all the attributes have the same scale. Use the scale 0 to 1 for the feature information of this dataset. 
    2. The next is to binarize the data. Transform the whole data set using a binary threshold. 
         All values above the threshold are marked 1 and all equal to or below are marked as 0. 
         Use the threshold value 0.0 for all the features of this dataset. Print the head of the transformed data. 
    3. The last step is to standardize the data, which is essential for analysing data distribution. 
         Standardize the data associated with this dataset to a standard Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. 
(Hint. Use the scikit-learn library) 

Q2.  Perform the following cleaning operations on the spam.csv dataset.
    1.Remove the punctuations (e.g., !, #, @ etc.). Make use of apply() function or use the regular expression to do the same. 
    2.Remove the stopwords following the library available in nltk.
